üëã Hey there! I'm Rafael Feliciano - an enthusiastic Front-End Developer, life-long learner, and tech innovator at heart, with a journey that's taken me from early childhood fascination with technology through engineering, graphic design, video editing, and entrepreneurship. Now settled in Australia, I've navigated various roles, sharpening my adaptability, communication, and rich problem-solving skills, always circling back to my tech love.

üåê I'm all about creating visually stunning, user-friendly interfaces, diving deep into HTML, CSS (Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS), JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Next.js, not to mention a knack for Adobe Products to ensure design excellence. My self-taught journey is fueled by a passion for technological innovation, underscored by my diverse experiences in and out of the tech scene, which have honed my ability to think creatively and tackle technical challenges with a fresh perspective.

üöÄ Driven by the dream to make a significant impact through technology, I've embarked on front-end development, showcasing my technical prowess and project management skills across various projects. From websites to digital solutions, I'm all about merging technical know-how with creativity, underpinned by a commitment to continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest trends and best practices in the industry.

üèÑ Outside of coding, you'll find me surfing the waves, exploring new horizons, or jamming my guitar - activities that fuel my creative problem-solving abilities, crucial in the tech world. Freelancing and ever on the lookout for dynamic teams or projects to contribute to, I'm eager to bring my diverse skills, insights, and enthusiastic approach to an entry-level development role.

üåü If you're seeking a developer who blends technical expertise with a unique creative edge, let's connect! I'm on a mission to help others through technology, eager to contribute meaningfully and push boundaries in the tech industry.
