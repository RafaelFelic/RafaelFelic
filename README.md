üëã Hey there! I'm Rafael Feliciano - an enthusiastic Front-End Developer, life-long learner, and tech innovator at heart, with a journey that's taken me from early childhood fascination with technology through engineering, graphic design, video editing, and entrepreneurship. Now settled in Australia, I've navigated various roles, sharpening my adaptability, communication, and rich problem-solving skills, always circling back to my tech love.

üåê I'm all about creating visually stunning, user-friendly interfaces, diving deep into HTML, CSS (Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS), JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Next.js, not to mention a knack for Adobe Products to ensure design excellence. My self-taught journey is fueled by a passion for technological innovation, underscored by my diverse experiences in and out of the tech scene, which have honed my ability to think creatively and tackle technical challenges with a fresh perspective.
